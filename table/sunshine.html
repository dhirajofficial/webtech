<h1>Sunshine</h1>
<p>
The Sun in the center of our solar system is a yellow dwarf star. It gives off energy as light. 
That includes light, infra-red energy (heat), ultraviolet light and radio waves. 
It also gives off a stream of particles, which reaches Earth as "solar wind". 
The source of all this energy is the reaction in the star which turns hydrogen into helium and makes huge amounts of energy.<br><br>
The Sun is a star like many others in our Milky Way galaxy. It has existed for a little over 4.5 billion years, 
and is going to continue for at least as long. The Sun is about a hundred times as wide as the Earth. 
It has a mass of 1.9891×1030 kg, which is 333,000 times the mass of the Earth. 
The Earth can also fit inside the Sun 1.3 million times. <b><a href="#">Read more &raquo</a></b>
